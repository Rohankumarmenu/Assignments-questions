For the lottery question:-

Now, we can make requests to the Winner Microservice API endpoint at http://localhost:3000/checkNumber/:num, where "num" is the number you want to check. The Microservice will connect to the MongoDB database, search for the number, and return a JSON response indicating whether the number is a winner or not.

Note: This example assumes you have MongoDB installed and running locally on the default port (27017). we can modify the connection details (mongoUrl, dbName, collectionName) according to your MongoDB setup.
